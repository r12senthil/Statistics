Data as a table
The pandas data-frame

Hypothesis testing: comparing two groups
Student’s t-test: the simplest statistical test
Paired tests: repeated measurements on the same indivuals

Linear models, multiple factors, and analysis of variance
“formulas” to specify statistical models in Python
Multiple Regression: including multiple factors
Post-hoc hypothesis testing: analysis of variance (ANOVA)

More visualization: seaborn for statistical exploration
Pairplot: scatter matrices
lmplot: plotting a univariate regression

Testing for interactions
